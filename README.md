# QR-entries-register

This app is made for read and watch previous QR scanned codes. You can also send the data to SQL server as you want.
NOTE: This app is still in progress - not all features are available.

## Usage
In order to use this app, you need to install flutter(via Visual Studio Code, Android Studio etc.), connect your phone with USB and deploy the [main.dart](lib/main.dart) file. 
NOTE: I tried to deploy only on Android device, So IOS support is NOT guaranteed.
